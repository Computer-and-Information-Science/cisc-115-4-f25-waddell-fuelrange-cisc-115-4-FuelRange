# Fuel Range

Write a program that will calculate the number of miles a gas powered vehicle can be driven on the fuel remaining in its fuel tank.

The program should prompt for and input the following values (in the order given here):

* The capacity of the fuel tank in gallons. This value may contain a fractional part.
* The miles per gallon for the vehicle. This value may also contain a fractional part.
* The percentage to which the tank is filled. This is an integer value from 0 to 100.

The program should report the number of miles the vehicle can be driven on the remaining fuel.

For example, if the three values are given as `15.5`, `25.3`, and `75` respectively, the output should be:

```
The vehicle can be driven 294.113 miles on the remaining fuel.
```
